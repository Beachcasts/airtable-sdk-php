##Welcome to the Beachcasts Airtable SDK Documention

The purpose of this project is to make using the Airtable API as simple as possible. Also, it enables PHP developers to use current conventions to interact with the REST style API at Airtable. This is done by including the GuzzleHttp package to abstract the cURL usage, and facilitate PSR-7 standards if your application uses it. However, you are not forced to comply with PSR-7 if so desired because it happens internally for the SDK.

This documentation is a work-in-progress. But the links will get you going quickly:
