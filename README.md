This Airtable SDK for PHP makes it easier to leverage the Airtable API leveraging popular PHP conventions.

NOTE: This project is under active development, and is NOT ready for use.

## Prerequisites

* Composer installed globally
* PHP v7.2+

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require beachcasts/airtable-sdk-php
```

## Usage

Rename `.env.default` to `.env`, and update as needed.

Below is what a sample usage might look like, in the SDK current unfinished state.
``` php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

use Beachcasts\Airtable\Table;
use Beachcasts\Airtable\AirtableClient;

Dotenv\Dotenv::create(__DIR__)->load();

$baseId = '<base_id>';

$airtableClient = new AirtableClient($baseId);

$table = new Table('Content production');
$content = $table->list($airtableClient->getClient(), 'Content pipeline');

echo $content->getBody()->getContents();
```

## Change log

Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on what has changed recently.

## Testing
Running the test suite requires the manual creation of a `Base` at Airtable. Log into your Airtable account and `Add a base` using the `Start from scratch` method. Let the new base creation retain the default `Untitled Base` name. You can customize as desired, but this will require you to also update the tests.

Next, you will need the `base_id` in order to run the tests, as well as the `api_key`. By going to the [Airtable API docs](https://airtable.com/api) you can now click into the new test base and view the `base_id`. Likewise, you can check the box in the upper right to display the api key.

Add the key and id to the `phpunit.xml`, which can be created from the `phpunit.xml.dist` file.

Following that, tests can be run with the following command:

``` bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```
